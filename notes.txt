Welcome to William Ezrine's URL Shortener Exercise for STORD.

////////////////////////

How to run:

1). Open a terminal, clone the repository and cd into it using:
	
	cd ~/Desktop
	git clone https://github.com/wezrine/UrlShortener.git
	cd UrlShortener

2). Create three separate tabs in Terminal (all at ./UrlShortener) run:
	
	1st). make setup
	2nd). make server
	3rd). make test

	# Keep in mind, 'make test' may take a few minutes to run and deliver results in terminal

3). Enjoy the app! The Makefile will have started the app, server, and run the tests.

Notes about my approach:

- Slug Generation

To generate the slug used for identifying the input url, I used the built in Math.random() function to randomly select characters from a provided list. While this method does not ensure each slug is unique, the odds of two slugs being the same was low enough for me to feel this was a viable approach for this excercise.
